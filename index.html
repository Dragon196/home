<h3>How and when did I get idea to start my channel??</h3>
    <p>Once I went for trekking on a mountain. I found a few stones and I kept them in my backpack as I wanted to check if it was magnetic. When I returned home, I found out it was magnetic. Around that time, I ordered a few test tubes, so I thought it would be great if I managed to get the Iron out of it. I already had a stereo microscope. So I obtained some ipure Iron by method in the video above ^. Thats how it all started. I thought it would be good if I uploaded that idea on Youtube. Then I recorded it and uploaded it.</p>
